To introduce the Topic Maps technology to the .NET world, the goal of this project is a small and extensible Topic Maps engine based on the [TMAPI.Net project](http://sourceforge.net/projects/tmapinet) that implements the TMAPI 2.0 interfaces and unit test.

Another objective is compatibility with a wide range of plattforms like .NET 2.0+, Mono, .NET Compact Framework and Silverlight. That's why the resulting engine should be small and lightweight.

#### Remarks to this version ####
This is the first release of the current development state. The one and only goal for this was to pass all tests from the [TMAPI.Net](http://sourceforge.net/projects/tmapinet) project. In 1.0.91 alpha 1 is neither any optimization, import, export nor hosting components (e.g. command line application). It is just a library, that can be used for in-memory Topic Map creation to play around.
